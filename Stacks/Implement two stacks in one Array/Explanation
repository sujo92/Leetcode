Create one array
for two stacks have two top pointer
one pointing to -1 of array
one to size of array
as elemets are pushed, update top pointer depending on which stack you are pushing on and put element in array
stack overflow occurs when next of current pointer is already occupied by other pointer that means no more space available in array.
